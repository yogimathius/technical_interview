# Technical Interviews Breakout Lecture Checklist

This breakout lecture focuses on hands-on problem-solving for technical interviews. We will cover two types of interview questions: "White Board Interview" style and "Pair Programming / Code Review and Refactoring" style.

-------------------------------------------

## Agenda

1. Introduction
   - [ ] Whiteboard Interview vs Code Review Interview

2. White Board Interview Style Questions 
   - [ ] "Average Student Scores.": Present the problem statement and requirements.
   - [ ] Discuss the problem-solving approach:
     - [ ] Ask questions to clarify the problem.
     - [ ] Think aloud and discuss potential solutions.
     - [ ] Provide pseudo-code and explanation of the solution.
     - [ ] Demonstrate testing the logic on a whiteboard.

3. Q&A and Discussion

4. Pair Programming / Code Review and Refactoring Style Questions 
   - [ ] "Code Review": Present the problem statement and requirements.
   - [ ] Discuss the problem-solving approach:
     - [ ] Ask questions to clarify the problem.
     - [ ] Think aloud and discuss potential solutions.
     - [ ] Demonstrate pair programming, code review, and refactoring techniques.

5. Q&A and Wrap-up 

-------------------------------------------

## For Whiteboard Interviews

### Explore the problem:

- Ask clarifying questions to gain a clear understanding of the problem.
- Analyze the provided data and requirements.
- Identify any edge cases or special scenarios.

### Verbalize your thought process:

- Think aloud and discuss potential approaches or strategies.
- Explain your reasoning behind the chosen approach.
- Consider trade-offs and discuss their implications.

### Plan your solution:

- Provide pseudo-code to outline the steps of your solution.
- Break down the problem into smaller subproblems if necessary.
- Discuss data structures and algorithms you intend to use.

### Solve the problem:

- Write the code on the whiteboard or explain it step-by-step.
- Focus on clarity, readability, and correctness of the code.
- Discuss any optimizations or improvements, if applicable.

### Test your solution:

- Walk through the code on the whiteboard, demonstrating how it processes the input data.
- Trace the execution flow to ensure the desired output is reached.
- Consider edge cases and test them explicitly.
- Discuss the expected output and verify if your solution matches.

-------------------------------------------

## For Code Review Interviews

### Understand the code:

- Take the time to carefully read and understand the code provided.
- Ask clarifying questions if any parts are unclear or need further explanation.
- Identify the purpose and functionality of the code.

### Assess code quality and best practices:

- Evaluate the code for readability, following coding standards, and adhering to best practices.
- Look for areas where the code can be optimized or improved.
- Check if the code is modular and follows principles such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and separation of concerns.

### Identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities:

- Analyze the code for any logical errors, potential bugs, or security vulnerabilities.
- Consider how input validation and error handling are implemented.
- Look for potential issues related to data integrity, security, or performance.

### Offer constructive feedback:

- Clearly communicate your observations and suggestions for improvement.
- Provide actionable feedback, explaining the rationale behind your recommendations.
- Be respectful and considerate in your approach to foster collaboration.

### Demonstrate refactoring skills:

- If you identify areas in the code that can be refactored, discuss possible techniques.
- Explain how the refactored code would address the identified issues and provide benefits.
- Focus on improving code structure, readability, performance, or maintainability.

### Summarize the review:

- Recap the main points discussed during the code review.
- Provide a concise summary of the code's strengths and areas for improvement.
- Conclude the review on a positive note, acknowledging any good practices or well-implemented features.

-------------------------------------------

## Summary

- Think out loud as much as possible during the whiteboard interview.
- Consider edge cases to demonstrate forward thinking and thoroughness.
- Vocalize your thoughts to avoid long periods of silence.
- Even if uncertain, share your ideas and explore different possibilities.
- Ask clarifying questions to gather more information about the problem.
- By following these strategies, you can effectively showcase your problem-solving skills and technical abilities during a whiteboard interview.

Happy problem-solving!
