### Average Student Scores

> You are tasked with implementing a function in NodeJS that takes an array of objects representing students and their scores, and returns the average score for each student. Each student object contains two properties: "name" (string) and "scores" (array of numbers). The average score should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

> Here's an example array of student objects:

```javascript
const students = [
  {
    name: "Alice",
    scores: [85, 90, 92, 88, 95]
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    scores: [75, 80, 82, 78, 85]
  },
  {
    name: "Charlie",
    scores: [92, 88, 95, 90, 85]
  }
];
```

> Your task is to write a function called `calculateAverageScores` that takes the students array as input and returns an object containing the average score for each student.

> Your function should follow these guidelines:

> * Avoid using classes and other advanced concepts. Stick to plain JavaScript.
> * Ensure that the average score is rounded to the nearest whole number.
> * Write code that solves the problem, but it can be improved in obvious ways.

> Please provide your solution code below.
